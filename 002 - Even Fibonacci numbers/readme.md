## Problem
* Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
```
    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```
* By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Notes
In my quest to understand generators, I came across a [Fibonacci generator](http://intermediatepythonista.com/python-generators). I did not intend to find one to copy into my solution, but there wasn't another way to write it:
```
def fib():
    a, b = 1, 2
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
```
Generators without limits are tricky. The actual code from the source is:
```
def fib(max):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < max:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
```
You'll notice the argument `max` does some internal bounds checking. In my case, I wanted to control the limit externally. Generators are used in an iterative fashion (they're really just a pretty iterator that do fun things). So, because I didn't provide any internal bounds checking, I had to do it, rather sloppily, in my own code. It isn't perfect but it does solve the problem and demonstrate the use of generators.

P.S. I am writing this at 1:11 am, so please judge the doc lightly. Thanks.
